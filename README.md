- 10 new deadly, or not ;) diseases have been added
   - Malaria
   - Bubonic Plague
   - Smallpox
   - Typhoid (fever)
   - Influenza
   - Leprosy
   - Rabies
   - Pneumonia
   - Tuberculosis
   - Trachoma
   
- The ill trait has been removed entirely from the game, even stories
   - All stories and event options with a prev. ill trait were given different new disease trait probabilities reflecting the event
   
- All 10 new diseases are scripted like the mortailty in real-life was back in ancient times
   - Each disease tries to reflect the real threat from these diseases with different values
   - The negative rating you would get for the trait ill was always -2 Courage, now each disease reflects different ratings depending on its threat

- In the base game there are only a few stories were you have a probability to get an extra disease upon your recently gained disease
   - Now more probabilities are added for follow up diseases, or not, depends on the disease

- In the base game in certain circumstences SEVERELY_ILL cant happen when ILL is currently "active"
   - There is no change in the mod, so your characters are not infested with more than one, max. 2 diseases at once ;)

- SEVERELY_ILL is still in the game but heavily reduced (for stories) and those stories with the trait have been reworked with the new diseases as well
<br><br><br><br>
- More harmless illnesses (like, fever, diarrhea, nausea, etc.) could be added, too to add more varietly on more harmless "diseases" or illnesses in this case
