- The ill trait has been removed entirely from the game, even stories
   - All stories and event options with a prev. ill trait were given different new disease trait probabilities reflecting the event
   
- All 10 new **diseases** are scripted like the mortailty in real-life was back in ancient times
   - Each disease tries to reflect the real threat from these diseases with different values
   - The negative rating you would get for the trait ill was always -2 Courage, now each disease reflects different ratings depending on its threat

- In the base game there are only a few stories were you have a probability to get an extra disease upon your recently gained disease
   - Now more probabilities are added for follow up diseases, or not, depends on the disease

- In the base game in certain circumstences SEVERELY_ILL cant happen when ILL is currently "active"
   - There is no change in the mod, so your characters are not infested with more than one, max. 2 diseases at once ;)

- Added and/or adjusted 3 gain and loss events for all diseases and illnesses
   - Adding also info about each disease and illness, like symptoms (in most cases its only one of three eventoptions, the other 2 are more generic like in the base game for "ill")

- SEVERELY_ILL is still in the game but heavily reduced (for stories) and those stories with the trait have been reworked with the new diseases as well
- This is set to be played on **standard difficulty**. If you want proper realistic death chances, please play with **realistic mortality**.
- You need to re-start the game after activating this mod, because its confusing the text when enabling the first time. Mohawk is aware but dont know why this is happening. After you re-started the game, everything is fine.
